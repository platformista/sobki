# Sobki Profile Bootstrap - Platform.sh and Upsun Template

This repository provides a [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) template for deploying the [Sobki Profile Bootstrap](https://www.drupal.org/project/sobki_profile_bootstrap) Drupal distribution, with full support also for [Upsun](https://upsun.com), the latest product by Platform.sh. The template includes all necessary configuration for deploying to both **Platform.sh** and **Upsun**, ensuring a seamless and scalable setup for either platform.

## Project Overview

**Sobki Profile Bootstrap** is a custom Drupal profile designed to accelerate the development of mobile-responsive websites by providing a default Bootstrap-powered theme and essential configurations out of the box. The Sobki profile combines a modern front-end framework with core Drupal functionality, offering an efficient starting point for developers.

Key features of Sobki Profile Bootstrap:

- **Bootstrap Integration**: The profile is built on top of the popular Bootstrap framework, ensuring responsive design and mobile-first layouts.
- **Pre-configured for Development**: Sobki comes with a ready-made setup that includes default content types, views, and blocks, which significantly reduce initial development time.
- **Flexible and Extendable**: The profile can easily be extended with custom themes, modules, and configurations to meet specific project needs.
- **Multilingual Support**: Sobki also includes default configurations for multilingual support, making it easy to create sites in multiple languages.

This template streamlines the deployment process for both **Platform.sh** and **Upsun**, allowing developers to focus on site development and customisation rather than infrastructure concerns.

## Features

- **Pre-configured for Platform.sh and Upsun**: Includes all necessary files to integrate and deploy the Sobki Profile Bootstrap on either Platform.sh or Upsun with minimal setup.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports multi-tier environments, including separate development, staging, and production branches.
- **Environment-specific Configuration**: Leverages both Platform.sh and Upsunâ€™s capabilities for different environment configurations, allowing for seamless testing and deployment.
- **Integrated with Platform.sh and Upsun Services**: Preconfigured database and cache services (MySQL, Redis) for optimised performance on both platforms.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a new Project on Platform.sh or Upsun

For Platform.sh:
Ensure you have the [Platform.sh CLI](https://docs.platform.sh/development/cli.html) installed and authenticated.

```bash
platform create
```

For Upsun:
Ensure you have the [Upsun CLI](https://docs.upsun.io/cli.html) installed and authenticated.

```bash
upsun create
```

### 2. Initialize the production environment with the template

For Platform.sh:

```bash
platform environment:init https://github.com/platformista/sobki
```

For Upsun:

```bash
upsun environment:init https://github.com/platformista/sobki
```

### 3. Access Your Application

Once deployed, you can access your Drupal installation via the generated URL provided by either Platform.sh or Upsun.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the `sobki_profile_bootstrap` profile to meet your specific needs. You can:

- Add additional modules to `composer.json`.
- Update configuration in the `config/sync` directory.
- Customise the `settings.platform.php` or `settings.upsun.php` files for further environment-specific tweaks.

## Services

The following services are included in this template by default:

- **MySQL**: Default database service for Drupal.
- **Redis**: For caching and performance optimisation.

Modify the `.platform/services.yaml` (Platform.sh) or `.upsun/config.yaml` (Upsun) file to adjust service specifications as necessary.
